* poll_examples
** watch_std_io
This is an example from the book /Linux System Programming/ by Robert Love.
Running this, we get the following, as expected:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./watch_std_io
stdout is writable
#+END_SRC

Running it again, but this time redirecting a file into standard in, we see both events:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$./watch_std_io < ../CMakeLists.txt
stdout is writable
stdin is readable. The first 10 chars are: cmake_mini
#+END_SRC
